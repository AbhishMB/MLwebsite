            <p>I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at The National Institute of Engineering (NIE), Mysore, since June 2014. My main area of research interest is development of polymer nanocomposites for opto-electronic applications and preparation of thin films for solar cells. I also work on biodegradable polymers for food packaging applications. Previously, I was working as a research scholar at NIE from 2011 to 2014, towards the research project entitled as “Development of CIGS based Nanomaterials for Photovoltaics”, funded by Vision Group on Science and Technology (VGST), GoK. I have also worked in Quality Control Department at Jubilant Life Science from 2010-2011. I have involved in several academic and professional activities and sponsored research projects  funded by KBITS on Exhaust gas carbon Extractor (EGCE). I took part in many national and international conferences, recently received best paper award in International Conference On ‘Advances in Materials, Ceramics & Engineering Sciences' ‘(AMCES- 2020)’. I am actively attended many FDP programs and short-term courses in reputed institutes. Recently, I have filed a patent on “A device to tap black carbon and other particulate matter from diesel engine vehicles”. I look forward to scientific and academic collaborations in my area of interest. Please visit our institute website for more information about my research activities.</p>
